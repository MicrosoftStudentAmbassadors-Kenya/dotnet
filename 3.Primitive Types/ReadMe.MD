Variables in C# or any programming languages are like Placeholders for our data.
They represent or have locations in the memory where our data is stored.
Using C# Variables have two steps
1. Declare the variable e.g   int number;
By doing this, we have specified a place in the memory of the computer to store a value of datatype integer.

2. Initiaze variable  i.e number = 10;
To initialize a vaiable is to assign a value to it. In the first step, we told the memeory that we want some space to store a value of type integer, in this step, we are giving the actual value to be stored.
3. After declaring and initializing the variable, we can now use the variable within the scope of our program. You wil  understand terms like scope later in the program.
